UTP Student Experience Application

## Getting Started
A few resources to get you started if you interested of this project:

* [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
* [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)
* [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/get-started/)
* [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/)
* [Development wiki](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Terms of service
The Flutter tool may occasionally download resources from Google servers. By
downloading or using the Flutter SDK, you agree to the Google Terms of Service:
https://policies.google.com/terms

For example, when installed from GitHub (as opposed to from a prepackaged
archive), the Flutter tool will download the Dart SDK from Google servers
immediately when first run, as it is used to execute the `flutter` tool itself.
This will also occur when Flutter is upgraded (e.g. by running the `flutter
upgrade` command).
